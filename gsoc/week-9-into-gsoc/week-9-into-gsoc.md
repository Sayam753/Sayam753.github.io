# Week 9 into GSoC

The second evaluation for GSoC is cleared. I am happy. Also, the PR [#289](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc4/pull/289) for Full Rank ADVI is merged in. This week's time is spent adding small but useful features to PyMC4. The PR [#310](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc4/pull/310) includes addition of progress bar. I spent most of the time digging deep into TFP codebase learning how vi module is integrated. Some more features to be included are -

- Parameter Convergence checks
- Low Rank Approximation
- Add a notebook playing around with mcmc and VI approximations over hierarchial models.

I plan to complete all these features before 15 August so that I can spend time writing documentation for PyMC4.
I am loving my time with PyMC community.
