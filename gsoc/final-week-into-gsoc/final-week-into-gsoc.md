# Final Week into GSoC

Hello all. So, this blog is meant to summarize the work done in the last week of GSoC. I will write a separate post covering the entire work done in three months. Stay tuned.

I have been working on adding features to ADVI. Here is the PR [#310](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc4/pull/310).

- [X] Add progress bar support.
- [X] Test progress bar in different OS.
- [X] Add ParameterConvergence criteria to test convergence.
- [X] Add LowRank Approximation.
- [X] Add LowRank ADVI tests.
- [X] Update quickstart notebook.

The only thing left is including a sample notebook playing around with hierarchical models and VI. I have already written half of it. Hope this PR will get merged soon.

See you soon.

Thanks
Sayam Kumar
