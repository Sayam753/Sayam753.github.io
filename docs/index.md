Hello all and welcome to my blog. I am Sayam Kumar, an AI Research Engineer @ [Phaidra](http://phaidra.ai/) where we create AI-powered control systems for industrial processes.

I love to work in the field of AI because I am inspired by observing how AI positively impacts various domains like healthcare, astronomy, climate-change, e-commerce, etc.

In my free time, I like to travel, play chess and listen to Punjabi/Hindi music.

This year I am looking forward to dig deeper into Reinforcement Learning, improve my fitness consistently, and pick up learning violin.
