Hello all and welcome to my blog. I am Sayam Kumar, an AI Research Engineer @ <a href="https://phaidra.ai">Phaidra</a> where we create AI-powered control systems for industrial processes.<br><br>

I love to work in the field of AI because I am inspired by observing how AI positively impacts various domains like healthcare, astronomy, climate-change, e-commerce, etc.<br><br>

In my free time, I like to travel, play chess and listen to Punjabi/Hindi music.<br><br>

This year I am looking forward to dig deeper into intersection of Reinforcement Learning and Bayesian statistics, improve my fitness consistently, and pick up learning violin.<br><br>
