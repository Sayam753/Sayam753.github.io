# Git

* Git is a distributed version control system.
* Svn is a central control system.
* In central control system, all the files are stored in the server's database. In distributed vcs, everybody has a local repository.
* There are three areas -
    + `Working Directory` - Where we put up all the files and codes in the local repository. We need to add them.
    + `Staging Area` - Where we commit our files
    + `Repo` - Contains all the files

## Basic Commands

```bash
git --version
git config --global user.name "<user-name>"
git config --global user.email "<user-email-ID>"
git config --global --list
git config --local --list
git help <verb>
git <verb> --help
git init  # For initialising a repository with git
rm -rf .git  # To stop tracking
touch .gitignore  # To put all the unwanted files which we do not want to git
git remote -v  # Info about remote repo
```

### Save changes

```bash
git status
git add -A  # Adds files to staging area
git commit -m "Message"
git pull origin master  # If remote is set
git push origin master
```

### Create a new git repo with existing code

```bash
git init  # In the folder. Also create a new repo in GitHub
git add -A
git commit -m "message"
git remote add origin link_to_repo
git push -u origin master
```

## Branches

Common Overflow - create a branch for desire feature

```bash
git branch  # To check the current branch
git branch my_branch  # To initialise a branch
git checkout my_branch  # To change the branch
git checkout -b my_branch  # Single command for above two operations
```

After adding and commiting, push branch to remote

```bash
git push -u origin my_branch  # To create a separate branch in the repo with the modified changes
git branch -a  # Check all branches at local as well as remote repo
```

### Merge a branch

```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git branch --merged
git merge my_branch
git push origin master
```

### Delete a branch

```bash
git branch --merged  # To check if everything is merged correctly
git branch -d my_branch  # Deleted locally
git branch -D my_branch  # Delete branch forcefully, if not merged
git branch -a  # To check
git push origin --delete my_branch
```

## Fixing Mistakes and Bad Commits

### Rename a message after a commit

But this changes the hash of the commit as the hash depends of message. This also changes the git history so it is not a good option.

```bash
git commit --amend -m "Added add function"
```

### Add a file to previous commit

First add that file to staging area. This again changes the git history.

```bash
touch new.py
git add new.py
git commit --amend  # Amend the file to last commit. Vim is opened asking for any changes in commit message. OR
git commit --amend --no-edit  # To keep the last commit message same
git log --stat  # To see changes in a commit
```

### Move a commit to different branch

1. Copy the `hash` of commit you want to move -

    ```bash
    git checkout <branch-name>
    git cherry-pick <hash-of-commit>  # The changes are reflected but the commit hash is changed
    ```

2. Remove that `commit` from previous branch -

    ```bash
    # Remove from branch
    git checkout <branch-name>

    # Three different types of reset -
    git reset --soft <previous-commit-hash-of-branch>  # It will keep the changes in staging area.
    git reset <previous-commit-hash-of-branch>  # Mixed reset - It will keep the changes in the working directory.
    git reset --hard <previous-commit-hash-of-branch>  # Remove all the changes from tracked files. All new files added will be there in working directory. Untracked files are left
    ```

    **Warning**- Use of `git reset --hard`, will reset to `previous commit` only when files are staged or commited. If they are in working directory, git reset --hard will reset only tracked files.

3. To delete untracked files/directories forcefully -

    ```bash
    git clean -df
    ```

4. Retrieve critical files that were lost, and you want them back -

    ```bash
    git reflog  # Copy the hash
    git checkout <hash-copied-from-reflog>  # Now the head is detached. You need to create a branch if you want those changes
    git branch backup  # Create a backup branch
    ```

### Git revert

Creates new commit on top of earlier commits to revert the changes.

```bash
git revert <hash-of-commit>
```

## Using stash command

Git stash helps when you have some uncommitted changes. You want to revert or switch between branches. Stash will temporarily save your changes.

1. Save you changes before moving around.

    ```bash
    git stash save "Message for your changes"
    git stash save -u "Message for your changes"  # For including all untracked as well
    git stash save --all "Message for your changes"  # For including all untracked and ignored files as well
    git stash list  # To list out all our stashes
    ```

2. Explore whatever you wish like.

3. View the contents of the stash

    ```bash
    git stash show -p  # For latest stash
    git stash show -p stash:{index}  # For a particular stash
    ```

4. Get those changes back

    1. Use `git stash apply`

        ```bash
        git stash apply  # To apply the latest stash
        git stash apply stash:{index}  # To see the changes OR
        git stash list  # But it does not get rid of the stash
        git checkout -- .  # To return to spec
        ```

    2. Use `git stash pop`

        ```bash
        git stash pop  # Applies the changes of topmost in git stash list and remove that one OR
        git stash pop stash:{index}  # Apply and delete
        git stash list  # That stash has been removed
        ```

5. Let's suppose now you do not want to keep that changes

    1. Drop a single stash

        ```bash
        git stash drop  # For topmost stash
        git stash drop stash:{index}  # For a specific stash
        ```

    2. Drop all stashes

        ```bash
        git stash clear
        git stash list  # Empty list
        ```

6. Stashes are carried from branch to branch

    ```bash
    git stash save "Message"
    git checkout <branch_name>
    git stash pop
    ```

7. Create a new branch and apply that stash - The stash is also deleted.

    ```bash
    git stash branch <branch_name>  # For topmost stash
    git stash branch <branch_name> stash:{index}  # For a specific stash
    ```

**Note** - The `git stash save` API is deprecated in favour of new `git stash push` API from 2.16 version onwards.

## Different Types of git add

1. Stage all the changes including untracked and .dot files, in the `entire working tree`

    ```bash
    git add --all
    git add --all <directory-name>  # It will only stage changes made in that directory
    git add <directory-name>  # --all or -A option is by default
    git add --no-all <directory-name>  # It will stage only modified and new files, not the deleted ones in directory
    ```

2. Stage only modified and deleted files, in the entire working directory, `-u` or `--update`

    ```bash
    git add -u
    git add -u <directory-name>  # It will stage only modified and deleted, not the new ones in the directory
    ```

3. Stage all the changes including untracked and .dot files, in the `current working directory and below` not the parent ones.

    ```bash
    git add .  # Changes will be visible if we run this command in any sub directory
    ```

4. Stage with "*" It will stage the files it can see in ls - This is not recommended as its not including deleted as well as .dot files

    ```bash
    git add *
    ```

# Rename
git mv <old filename> <new filename>  # Rename a file
git branch -m <newname>  # Rename a branch while working on branch
