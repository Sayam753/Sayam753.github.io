Hello all and welcome to my blog. I am Sayam Kumar, a pre final year undergraduate pursing Bachelors in Computer Science. I have lots of interest in Bayesian statistics. Recently, I started learning about Multivariate distributions and drawing samples from them when their parameters itself are Random Variables. So, I am spending my days handling shapes in random sampling.
