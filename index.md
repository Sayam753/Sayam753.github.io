Hello all and welcome to my blog. I am Sayam Kumar, a final year undergraduate pursuing Bachelors in Computer Science @[iiits.in](https://iiits.in/). Right now, I am interning as AI Research Engineer @[phaidra.ai](http://phaidra.ai/) where we create AI-powered control systems for industrial processes.

I love to work in the field of AI because of how it mentally challenges one to find creative solutions to existing problems. I am also inspired by observing how AI positively impacts other domains like Healthcare and E-Commerce.

In my free time, I am a silent observer of all the good things happening in [PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc) organization. And when I feel sufficient adrenaline rush, I do contribute to PyMC.

I also like to play chess. So, hit me up @[sayamkumar049](https://www.chess.com/member/sayamkumar049) at chess.com if you wanna play a match.

This year, I am looking forward to start with Reinforcement Learning and dig deep into it.
